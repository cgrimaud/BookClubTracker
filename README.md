# Book Club Tracker Console App

In this project a user will have access to three book club events from the first three months of 2019. A book club meet up consists of book title, author, genre, date we met, and place we met. 

The user can view all of the meet ups, add a new meet up, edit a past meet up, or delete a past meet up. This can be done via the main menu by selecting the approprate numbers corresponding with the options. 

Any changes the user makes to the meet ups will dynamically change the MeetUps list object. The next time the user runs the application, those changes will still be apparent. 

*Note: this application does not currently contain any validation.*
